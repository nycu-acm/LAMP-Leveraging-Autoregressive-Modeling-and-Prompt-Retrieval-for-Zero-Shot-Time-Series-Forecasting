  "trend": "You are forecasting the long-term trend of oil temperature in a electric power dataset called Electricity Transformer Temperature (ETT), sampled every 1 hour over 2 years. Focus on modeling smooth and gradual structural changes over time.",
  "seasonal": "You are forecasting the unknown seasonal variation of oil temperature in the electric power dataset Electricity Transformer Temperature (ETT), sampled every 1 hour. Focus on modeling repeating cycles or periodic patterns in the data.",
  "residual": "You are estimating short-term irregular fluctuations in oil temperature in the dataset Electricity Transformer Temperature (ETT) after removing trend and unknown seasonality. The data is sampled at 1 hour and spans 2 years. Focus on modeling noise and unexpected spikes."
